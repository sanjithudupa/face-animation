# Train

### This makes several images from input images(warp them)

The technology behind this is very similar to that of Face Swap(think of Snapchat) but it is instead designed for a picture of two of the same people. This is just the first part of my overall face animation project.

By the way, this isn't really *training*, but it is similar in the sense that it has to be run once for the program to get all  the information  it needs about an image
